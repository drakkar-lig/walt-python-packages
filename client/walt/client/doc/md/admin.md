This section explains what you need to know to install and maintain your own WalT platform.

## Installation

To build a WalT platform, install and connect the following components:
- install a WalT server, see [`walt help show server-install`](server-install.md);
- connect one or several network switches, see [`walt help show switch-install`](switch-install.md);
- setup and connect some nodes, see [`walt help show node-install`](node-install.md).

A basic understanding of WalT network structure may be useful, see [`walt help show networking`](networking.md).

## Upgrade

Upgrading your WalT platform just consists of a simple upgrade procedure on server side,
see [`walt help show server-upgrade`](server-upgrade.md).

## Using the built-in VPN setup

WalT provides a built-in VPN system allowing you to deploy distant nodes.
See [`walt help show vpn`](vpn.md) for more info.

## Troubleshooting

See [`walt help show troubleshooting`](troubleshooting.md).
