# Changing network mode for a WalT node

A selected WalT node (or unmanaged device) may be given internet connectivity (default mode is to isolate the WALT network for better experiment reproducibility)
by using commands `walt device config` or `walt node config` and changing the `netsetup` parameter.
See [`walt help show device-netsetup`](device-netsetup.md).
