# ** installing the code on the local machine:
# $ make 					# or make install
# $ make client.install		# install the client only (and common, its dependency)

# ** uploading the code to pypi (python package index) or pypitest
# $ make upload				# upload all packages
#
# Notes:
# - upload is directed to the appropriate repo depending on which git branch you are in:
#     - master  -> pypi
#     - test    -> pypitest
#     - [other] -> [forbidden]
# - targeting a specific component is not allowed in this case,
#   because the upload number is used for the version of each component,
#   so we must upload them all at once.

# ** pulling packages from pypi (python package index) or pypitest
# ** and installing them:
# $ make pull				# pull common, client and server
# $ make client.pull		# pull the client only (and common, its dependency)
#
# Notes:
# - pulling is performed from the appropriate repo depending on which git branch you are in:
#     - master  -> pypi
#     - test    -> pypitest
#     - [other] -> [forbidden]
