# There seem to be a race condition rarely occurring
# when mounting walt images in parallel.
# When the problem occurs, "buildah mount" seems to
# succeed, "findmnt" works, but "umount" fails with a
# message saying "not mounted" (we need this umount
# when trying to re-mount with NFS options included).
# Additional info:
# - the mount *is* listed by /proc/self/mounts.
# - the mountpoint appears empty
# - running "strace" on the "umount" command shows that
#   statfs() reports an ext2 filesystem instead of overlay,
#   and a simple program confirms this.
# In this situation, there seem to be no way to umount
# the filesystem (if ever it is really mounted??).
#
# It may also be related to the fact we were using
# "umount -lf", when the image was later un-mounted.
# We now use plain "umount" without "-lf".
#
# Still, since there seems to be a kernel issue, we
# implement a file lock to ensure mount (and umount, who knows)
# operations are serialized.
